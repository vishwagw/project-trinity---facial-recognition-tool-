This is a Python-based facial recognition tool for recognising faces in a given photo/ picture. This is the first prototype I have created for an advanced face recognition tool for my new project, the Trinity Home security system.
The algorithm we are creating is a supervised learning algorithm. 
First, we will create a database of pictures of the faces that we need to recognise in the training directory.
then we can add un-labelled data/photos to validate by the algorithm.
previously, I described the basic functions of a face recognition algorithm.
Currently, we are creating a more-advanced software tool to identify people when they are standing in front of an actual camera. 
This entire program is based on Python. check requiremebts.txt to install the required Python libraries.
